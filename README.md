# Pokemon Pure Gold
An incomplete Gameboy Advance ROM hack based on Pokemon Ruby (U) aimed at remaking the Gameboy Color games of Pokemon Gold, Silver & Crystal.

Most of the work done on this was lost when my hard drive crash. This is one of the earlier versions of the hack.

# What's done
- Upgraded existing graphics and tilesets based on Fire Red & Leaf Green
- Ported some maps over from Pokemon Gold
- Inserted some tunes from Pokemon Gold

# Getting Started
- Download the Pokemon Ruby (U) ROM
- Download an patching program e.g. Lips
- Apply the IPS patch against your ROM
